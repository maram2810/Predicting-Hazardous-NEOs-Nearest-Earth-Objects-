Predicting Hazardous NEOs 🚀


📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous using NASA's dataset from 1910 to 2024.

📊 Dataset

338,199 records of observed NEOs
Features include diameter, velocity, distance, and hazard classification


⚙️ Approach

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features
EDA: Visualized distributions, correlations, and class imbalance
Preprocessing: Applied feature scaling, encoding, and SMOTE for balancing
Modeling: Trained a Random Forest model
Evaluation: Used Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC


📈 Results

Best Model: Random Forest
F1-Score (Hazardous): 93%
AUC-ROC: 0.982
