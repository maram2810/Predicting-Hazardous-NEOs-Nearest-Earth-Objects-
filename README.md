# Predicting Hazardous NEOs 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous using NASA's dataset from 1910 to 2024.

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains 338,199 records of observed NEOs.
- Includes features like diameter, velocity, distance, and hazard classification.

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary features.
2. **EDA:** Visualized distributions, correlations, and class imbalance.
3. **Preprocessing:** Applied feature scaling, encoding, and SMOTE for balancing.
4. **Modeling:** Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
5. **Evaluation:** Used Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression
- **F1-Score (Hazardous):** 93%
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.982
